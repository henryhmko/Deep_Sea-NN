# Sea-NN
Enhancing underwater images using a customized U-Net architecture forreal-time color correction applications.

---

Customized U-Net architecture inspired by [UWGAN: Underwater GAN for Real-world Underwater Color Restoration and Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10269).

Usage of U-Net for image-to-image-translation inspired [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004).
